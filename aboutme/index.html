        Hello, clasmates. My name is Tim, and I live in Mesa, Arizona. I've lived here my whole life with the exception of a mission in Mississippi and graduate school for Physical Therapy in Denver, CO. I've been working as a physical therapist for the last 8 years since graduating, but recently had several hip surguries that made full time work in that profession too difficult.

        So, I'm changing careers now! I have been messing with coding since I was 10 with basic. More recently I have been learning Python through several different avenues. That has done a lot to prepare me for these courses in Applied Tehcnology. I enjoy basketball, golf, spending time with my family and playing some video games. Thanks for reading even though we are required to!
