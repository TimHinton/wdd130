                        This is my dog, Moose. He is a French Bulldog. He is great, he is naughty, he is stubborn, he is sweet. This website is about my relationship with Moose and how things have developed over the last 4 years, specifically, how he has been a comfort and support for me during harder days.
                        My wife does not like dogs because they shed, drool, poop, pee and all of the other messy things. I really began to like frenchies in 2015 and told my wife I wanted one. She, of course, immediately said, "No, absolutely not." That was that for the time. Over the next couple of years I would show her cute/funny pictures or videos of frenchies. She slowly went from saying she thought frenchies were ugly to agreeing that they were cute. One fortuitous saturday, we were at our older son's soccer game and saw a darling little frenchie puppy! We all went over and loved on it and talked to the owner. I found out there was a local breeder and got the Facebook page for them. I contacted the owner and she was happy to have me come over and see the puppies she had at the time. So, I took my two boys over to her home and she brought out 2 puppies for us to pet and see! We adored them and had a great time, but left empty handed. Getting a dog isn't something that should be taken lightly and frenchies are stupid expensive!

                        Over the next few months I talked about how cute they were and how fun it would be to have one, but my wife remained unconvinced. Meanwhile, I was struggling - I was getting progressively more frustrated with my job and feeling a bit down overall. I wasn't making as much money as we hoped or needed and it was affecting us. As one last ditch effort, I contacted the breeder again to see the newest puppies she had. Again I took my two boys but my wife didn't go with us. I was probably taking the boys out of the house to give her a break more than anything, honestly. 
                        As we drove I was somewhat resigned, knowing that there was almost no chance anything would actually come from seeing the puppies and I would leave heartbroken...again. She brought out a puppy for us to see and we loved on it again. It was different this time. I very quickly started to feel connected to the puppy and could see him as part of our family. It was only when I told her of this feeling that he was family did my wife even consider a dog. To my surprise, 3 days later we brought him home.
                        Moose has always been my best little friend from then on. He is always there to snuggle, or even better, nap!

                        Just 2 years after getting Moose, I found out that I had whats called femoral acetabular impingement. And I had it bad. I was getting it from both sides of the hip joint and the left side was borderline unrecoverable. So, later that year I had a surgery to correct this on the right hip and then a month later a hip replacement on the left. Moose was waiting for me when I got home from each surgery, licking my face and so excited to see me again. He laid there for hours on my lap in the recliner while I slept off the anesthesia or pain medication. I think he could tell something was wrong and that I was hurting and he was there for me the best he could.
                        During this time I lost a lot of strength and endurance. I also continued to have pain in my back and in the left hip. It still hasn't fully recovered. I also have some lingering depression from having this chronic pain as well as losing a lot of my ability to play basketball, football, run, play golf, etc. Moose is always there to be close and help me to not get too down.
