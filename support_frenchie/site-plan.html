      <p>
        The site is all about my French Bulldog that I got certified as a support animal about a year ago and the main focus of the website is our relationship, how the relationship and the certification benefit me as well as some of the possible challenges associated with support animals. The targeted audience would be those who want to learn about support animals, those who would enjoy the pictures and the story as well as those who may be looking into getting or certifying a support animal.

      <h3>Introductions!</h3>
      <p>
        Moose is the star of the webpage. He is the first dog I got as an adult and it took a miracle to get my wife to agree. Well, actually it really just took my saying that I felt that he was already part of the family and I felt a special connection with him. And this was all true. We got him at about 9 weeks old and I was told his coloring is referred to as chocolate reverse brindle. I don't know much about dog colorings other than what they look like when I see them. Moose is now 4 years old and already acts like he is 70 most of the time. He usually has a grumpy look on his face and is very stoic until he gets excited and then he melts your heart.
Blu is the newest addition to the family, and not by my choice. My wife felt that Moose looked lonely and depressed and he needed a friend. Little did we know that we were getting a dog that has entirely too much energy and probably was the one who needed his own friend. He annoys me most of the time because he interrupts my interactions with Moose. He will bark pretty loud and nip at Moose to try to get him to play and usually gets jealous when Moose is on my lap or when I pet him and so attacks Moose. Blu can be a very good dog and is very obedient when he can control his enthusiasm, which is mostly only when I have a treat in my hand or the remote to his e-collar.

      <h3>Support Animals</h3>
      <p>
        How I got Moose certified as a support animal was fairly easy. I had been talking jokingly about doing this from the moment we brought Moose home. Then, about 2.5 years later, I had been seeing a Nurse Practitioner for depression and being overly sleepy. I asked her if she did anything with support animals and she said they did. The MA sent over a form that I filled out and within a couple of days they emailed me the document signed by the medical professional stating that Moose was now a support dog that was a part of my treatment for depression. It was that easy.
There are challenges that come up when trying to exercise this new freedom of taking Moose with me wherever I wanted. First, if a business has a notice or sign at the entrance that states no animals allowed, and they choose to enforce it, then I have to comply. Second, support animals are very different from working dogs such as seeing eye dogs, law enforcement dogs, etc. They are protected and should not be asked to leave by businesses or events whereas support animals are not and are usually treated as normal pets, though businesses are slightly more forgiving if I can show them the paperwork stating he is a support animal. Support animals do not need any formal training while the working dogs mentioned previously have strict training regiments and have a purpose beyond making me happy.
