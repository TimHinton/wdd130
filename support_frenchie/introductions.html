                        Moose is the star of the webpage. He is the first dog I got as an adult and it took a miracle to get my wife to agree. Well, actually it really just took my saying that I felt that he was already part of the family and I felt a special connection with him. And this was all true. We got him at about 9 weeks old and I was told his coloring is referred to as chocolate reverse brindle. I don't know much about dog colorings other than what they look like when I see them. Moose is now 4 years old and already acts like he is 70 most of the time. He usually has a grumpy look on his face and is very stoic until he gets excited and then he melts your heart.

                        Blu is the newest addition to the family, and not by my choice. My wife felt that Moose looked lonely and depressed and he needed a friend. Little did we know that we were getting a dog that has entirely too much energy and probably was the one who needed his own friend. He annoys me most of the time because he interrupts my interactions with Moose. He will bark pretty loud and nip at Moose to try to get him to play and usually gets jealous when Moose is on my lap or when I pet him and so attacks Moose. Blu can be a very good dog and is very obedient when he can control his enthusiasm, which is mostly only when I have a treat in my hand or the remote to his e-collar. And he has stinky gas...often.
