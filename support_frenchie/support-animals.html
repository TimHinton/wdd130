                        How I got Moose "certified" as a support animal was fairly easy, though this isn't technically correct. There isn't a certification for emotional support dogs, but a letter - but I will refer to it as certified or certification for ease of writing. I had been talking jokingly about doing this from the moment we brought Moose home. Then, about 2.5 years later, I had been seeing a Nurse Practitioner for depression and being overly sleepy. I asked her if she did anything with support animals and she said they did! The MA sent over a form that I filled out and within a couple of days they emailed me the document signed by the medical professional stating that Moose was now a support dog that was a part of my treatment for depression. It was that easy.

                        There are challenges that come up when trying to exercise this new freedom of taking Moose with me wherever I wanted. First, if a business has a notice or sign at the entrance that states no animals allowed, and they choose to enforce it, then I have to comply. Second, support animals are very different from working dogs such as seeing eye dogs, law enforcement dogs, etc. They are protected and should not be asked to leave by businesses or events whereas support animals are not and are usually treated as normal pets, though businesses are slightly more forgiving if I can show them the paperwork stating he is a support animal. Support animals do not need any formal training while the working dogs mentioned previously have strict training regiments and have a purpose beyond making me happy.
